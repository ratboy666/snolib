<h1>ALL - Include all library components</h1>

Include all library components. This is used for ad-hoc programming,
and tests to ensure that library components are compatible (for
example, no label collisions), and to determine load time.

This also gives us the compilation (load) time for the library. It
takes around 50 milliseconds to compile all of the library routines;
80 milliseconds if producing a listing file. This would (for example)
limit the number of CGI transactions to 200 per second on my netbook.

It takes 36 milliseconds to compile ALL.INC on my Intel i3 (1.4Ghz).

<i>Building</i> the library from lss source takes a long time.

[fred@dejah snolib] touch *.lss

1m52s to build on the i3.

The majority of the time in generating the library is spent generating
the html documentation (mostly in the <i>ditaa</i> utility.
