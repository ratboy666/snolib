SNOBOL4 Library

This is Fred Weigel's SNOBOL4 library. The SNOBOL4 community is very
small these days, but, heck, I still like the language, and I am sure
that others will too.

All modules now in github, but probably won't build! Sorry, I will
test building, and update the README.md file on completion with
instructions on what is needed for the build environment and required
changes.
